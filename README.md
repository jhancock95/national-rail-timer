# National Rail Timer

If, like me, you often travel by National Rail knowing train timings is important to your journey, as if you miss a train it may be 10+ minutes until the next one comes along. 

To check train times I've found myself opening up Google Maps and putting in my whole journey in order to get a simple piece of information. It's more time consuming than necessary, so I've put together an app that tells you when your next few trains are and if you can make it to the station in time, based on travel tie to the station.

Currently it's all manual, but I'm working on adding in Google Maps integration to automatically calculate journey time to the station if given a specific type of transport is selected.
